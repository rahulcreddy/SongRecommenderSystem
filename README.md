# SongRecommenderSystem

As per Forbes, Americans spend around 27 hours per week listening to music. One of the most challenging aspects of being a music lover is finding new songs that match your preferences. The search can be arduous and requires curating many choices until the perfect song is found. This issue can be addressed by using machine learning techniques to develop a song recommendation system that can analyze tracks given by the user and provide top recommendations based on their input.

Built a song recommender system using cosine-similarity technique. Extracted data of 10,000 songs from publicly available playlists using Spotify Web API and developed a Flask web application that generates personalized song recommendations with the userâ€™s song input. Fetches album cover and track url from Spotify Web API in real-time.
